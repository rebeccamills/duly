## Never Ending Story

Oh no, we have a recursive story! Open `never_ending_story.rb` and do the following:

* Write a program that prints out a story line, and then prompts:
	* **"Should we continue? (y/n)"**
	* If "n", use `break` to exit.
	* If "y", print the next line of the story.
* Do this indefinitely until the user chooses to stop. 
* Loop the story back to the beginning when you run out of story lines!
